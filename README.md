# EVA-Timer
This is my personal project, I had this project on school github account and i transfered it to my personal account (that´s why there is second contributor Vontor)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> this project is in two versions: **Python** (just console application) and **Website**

## Python part
- Timer just display in console
- japanese characters only work in VS & VSC and I tried to change font in CMD so It can display jpanese characters but the spaces are offset, so It looks horible)
  ### Guide to start
  - Please use file: EVA_Timer.py for actual timer.
  - U can use Timer.py for just segment display for numbers, it counts five minutes from zero.
## Website part
- Because I use old files from time I was starting programing, It´s just simple HTML, CSS and JS files, no framework. But I think I will keep It that way because It´s simple to copy It for beginners)
- If you start website in VSC with index.html you will be greeted with menu there will be one working option and that´s for EVA Timer **(!not finished!)**
- Timer will not be responsive! It will have same size and shape (I think It would look ulgy)
