# EVA-Timer
This is my personal project, I had the python and website in my PC that I randomly found when I started programing.
- this project is in two parts:
-  python part (Timer just display in console, japanese characters only work in VS & VSC and I tried to change font in CMD so It can display jpanese characters but the spaces are offset, so It looks horible)
-  website part (Because I use old files from time I was starting programing, It´s just simple HTML,CSS and JS files, no framework. But I think I will keep It that way because It´s simple to copy It for everyone else)

Sorry for mistakes in English (It´s not my native language).
